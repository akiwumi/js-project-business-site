## HTTPS
This project is a static site (HTML/CSS/JS). Switching the site from **HTTP to HTTPS** is done in your **hosting / domain** settings (SSL/TLS certificate + “force HTTPS” option).

In the codebase, make sure any external URLs use `https://` when available (example: the demo form endpoint in `index.html`).
